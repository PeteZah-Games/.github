## Our Projects

### [PeteZahGames](https://github.com/PeteZah-Games/PeteZahGames)
The world's most advanced proxy website. We hold 1000+ games, a proxy which has become so well used that we've expanded to three servers and our own AI chatbot and music player

### [PeteZah (Discord Bot)](https://github.com/PeteZah-Games/PeteZahBot)
PeteZah is our in-house developed all-purpose Discord Bot. We use it for a variety of services in our Discord Server.

### [PeteZah-Next](https://github.com/PeteZah-Games/PeteZahNext)
The next generation of PeteZahGames, PZN is made using the cutting-edge framework Next.JS. Once completed, it will have more exciting features and a cleaner UI. Despiote not having full proxy functionality, PZN is still some peoples' choice over PZG because of its optimizations, never-before-seen security features like a rotating password, and user interface.

### [PeteZah-Next (Discord Bot)](https://github.com/PeteZah-Games/PeteZah-Next-Password-Bot)
To aid people with accessing PeteZah-Next, we created a Discord bot which can be accessed in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/unrestricted). If you run our bot's `/password` command, it will provide you with the most recent PeteZah-Next password, which you can enter into the `input` field on the PZN homepage, which is disguised as a unit convertor.

### [PeteZahLite](https://github.com/PeteZah-Games/PeteZahLite)
A minimal single html version of our website containing just our games served on jsdelivr
